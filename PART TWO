    <h1>PART TWO</h1>
    <p id="Mytext">
      Imagine this, Raptors fans: Vince Carter returning to play with Toronto in
      the final years of his career. Kyle Lowry, another all-time Raptors great,
      claimed he tried to get it done. “I dont know if anybody knew this,” Lowry
      said on the retired players podcast, “The VC Show with Vince Carter.” “But
      I tried to get Vince back with us (the Raptors) at one point. I wanted
      Vince. I was trying.”
