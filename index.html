            The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and
            historical role as an important destination for immigrants to
            Canada. More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible
            minority population group,[28] and over 200 distinct ethnic origins
            are represented among its inhabitants.[29] While the majority of
            Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160
            languages are spoken in the city.[30] The mayor of Toronto is
            elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of
            the city. The Toronto City Council is a unicameral legislative body,
            comprising 25 councillors since the 2018 municipal election,
            representing geographical wards throughout the city.[31]

            Toronto is a prominent centre for music,[32] theatre,[33] motion
            picture production,[34] and television production,[35] and is home
            to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks
            and media outlets.[36] Its varied cultural institutions,[37] which
            include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events,
            entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports
            activities,[38] attract over 43 million tourists each year.[39][40]
            Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise
            buildings,[41] in particular the tallest free-standing structure on
            land in the Western Hemisphere, the CN Tower.[42]

            The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of
            Canada's five largest banks,[43] and the headquarters of many large
            Canadian and multinational corporations .[44] Its economy is highly
            diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial
            services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace,
            environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.[45][46][47]
            Toronto is the third-largest tech hub in North America after Silicon
            Valley and New York City, and the fastest growing.[48][49]

            In 1813, as part of the War of 1812, the Battle of York ended in the
            town's capture and plunder by United States forces.[63] John
            Strachan negotiated the town's surrender. American soldiers
            destroyed much of the garrison and set fire to the parliament
            buildings during their five-day occupation. Because of the sacking
            of York, British troops retaliated later in the war with the burning
            of Washington, D.C. American forces attacked York in 1813. The
            Americans subsequently plundered the town, and set fire to the
            legislative buildings. York was incorporated as the City of Toronto
            on March 6, 1834, adopting an Indigenous name. Reformist politician
            William Lyon Mackenzie became the first mayor of Toronto and led the
            unsuccessful Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 against the British
            colonial government.

            Long before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in
            1876, supporters of the concept proposed military colleges in
            Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a
            three-month-long military course at the School of Military
            Instruction in Toronto. Established by Militia General Order in
            1864, the school enabled officers of militia or candidates for
            commission or promotion in the Militia to learn military duties,
            drill and discipline, to command a company at Battalion Drill, to
            drill a company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a company,
            and the duties of a company's officer.[68] The school was retained
            at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, Schools of cavalry and artillery
            instruction were formed in Toronto.[69]

            Horse-drawn streetcars gave way to electric streetcars in 1891, when
            the city granted the operation of the transit franchise to the
            Toronto Railway Company. The public transit system passed into
            public ownership in 1921 as the Toronto Transportation Commission,
            later renamed the Toronto Transit Commission. The system now has the
            third-highest ridership of any city public transportation system in
            North America.[70]
